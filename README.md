# DeepLearningforNaturalDisasters

##Executive Summary

The aim of this project was to identify humans in real time by using deep learning methodologies for search and rescue operations.

I have deployed three algorithms which give real-time results when working on videos. The algorithms deployed here are:\
1.) Mask R-CNN\
2.) SSD\
3.) YOLOv3
